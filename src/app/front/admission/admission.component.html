														<h5 class="mt-2">Our Philosophy of Admissions</h5>

														<p>We at DPS Rajnagar aim to ensure that students not only excel at academics but also are imbued with social and ethical values, skills and attitudes to contribute positively to society. Therefore, the admission process is designed to test both aptitude and attitude. While the tests assess proficiency in English, Mathematics and Hindi, they also reveal the child’s problem solving skills. Portions integrated in the admission process also examine the applicant’s belief and value system on the basis of which he/she makes decisions and the way he/she handles and negotiates with the external world. Thus, our method of testing a student has been designed in such a way so that we can look at him/her holistically.</p>

														<h5>Admission Criteria – Nursery, Prep and  I</h5>
														<p>Age of child as on 1st April 2019, as recorded in the municipal birth certificate will determine the eligibility for admission to a particular grade.</p>
														<p>Recommended grades for children born between the following dates:</p>

											<h2>Admission</h2>
											<p>The curriculum is designed to ensure an all round development of each student. A comprehensive &amp; technologically-designed methodology is introduced at all stages to develop the intellectual personality required to achieve academic success. The medium of instruction is English and special emphasis is laid on both written and spoken English.</p>
											<p>During this five year period, the student's intellectual, aesthetic, physical and cultural growth and development are intensified and extended to a foundation course designed to suit students from all educational backgrounds. A smooth transition from childhood to adolescence is facilitated by imparting comprehensive values and need based education.</p>
											<p>This period puts students into top gear as they develop both the depth and breadth of the context in theory and application. Personalized attention at this stage prepares them to face the All India Secondary School Curriculum and CCE - Assessment of the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. We also guide students for NTSE in Grade X.</p>

We maintain a very low student teacher ratio to attain a personal attention to each student.</p>
															<p >DPS Rajnagar is part of the world renowned The Delhi Public School Society, East of Kailash, New Delhi which runs more than 200 schools in India and abroad.

														</a>
													</div>
													<div id="3" class="collapse " data-parent="#accordion">
														<div class="card-body">
															<p >The school counsellor is a specialist in child psychology and plays an important role in the overall development of children who need additional attention/care. The counsellor identifies such children and helps the teachers and parents to deal with these children effectively. You can take the counsellor's help in case you find changes in the attitudinal/behavioral pattern of your child. The counsellor can be of help in cases of hyperactive children, children with temporarily changed behaviour pattern due to bereavement/illness in the family or due to some external factor(s) etc.</p>

															What measures does the school take to make the students fluent in English? 
														</a>
													</div>
													<div id="4" class="collapse " data-parent="#accordion">
														<div class="card-body">
															<p >Efforts are made at all times to ensure that all students start speaking in English as early as possible. At DPS RAJNAGAR we recognize the socio-cultural background of our students and that is the reason why spoken English classes form a part of the routine Time Table and the School Assembly. To improve communication skills students are given every opportunity to present passages, poems, scriptures, extempore speeches, quizzes, etc in English. However, we seek active participation of the parents in this regard. We suggest that they should speak in English at home and encourage their wards to speak in English too. The child should be provided with age appropriate English books, newspapers and magazines. All students are given an English newspaper or periodical daily. This fosters good reading habit and propagates awareness building skills.</p>
