							<span class="qt">"</span>At the cusp of major global upheavals when opportunities and challenges are replacing each other DPS Rajnagar is moving 
							forward keeping its vision and mission in mind that children have to be prepared for the world which is going to change at a 
						much faster pace than we ever imagined. </p>

						<p>There are newer jobs emerging every year. One out of four jobs available to our children five years hence does not exist today. 
							And even the traditional job markets need skills which are not really dealt in normal curriculum. Communication is taking a 
							whole new dimension in every walk of life and it's redefining personal and professional spaces. Hence it became mandatory to 
						bring in the desired incremental changes in the school day.</p>

						<p>After a lot of thought, feedback and deliberation we are ready with the next sure step to give children more thought provoking 
						environment.</p>

						<p>One major change which we would like to incorporate in our school day is to bring children into a leader's seat. Instead of 
							teacher leading the classroom interactions and asking questions to which students have to answer we are doing role reversals now. 
							Students will ask questions and teacher will be answering. The school day will steadily include TED talks, film making, tech 
						shows, making apps, secure computer  challenges and many more.</p>

						<p>With the help of parents we would like to give children more opportunities to work in real time  environment and learn to 
						comprehend and adjust to various needs.</p>

						<p>All events are planned keeping in mind the educational value for the children in the given time.  With teacher-parent team 
							interacting with students at many levels, sky is the limit for our children. <span class="qt">"</span></p>
